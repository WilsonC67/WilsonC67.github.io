        <p>My background:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I finished middle school in HJMS, located in Simsbury, Connecticut.</li>
            <li>I graduated from Simsbury High School in 2024. Take a guess where it's located!</li>
            <li>Now, I am attending Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut. I am a current freshman majoring in their CS + Cybersecurity 3+1 program. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I got into Computer Science during my senior year in high school, where I was hooked by the intriguing nature of Computer Science.
            I found the underlying logic behind much of CS to be really interesting and I decided then to major in it.
