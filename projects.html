          <p>Hi! This is my projects page.</p>
          <p>Some programs that I'm proud of are below.</p>

          <h2>Maze Solver Program (Java)</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/WilsonC67/MazeSolver">GitHub</a>

          <ul>
            <li>This program was a project for CSC111. It takes a text file that ideally contains x's and blank spaces and returns a path that 
                successfully solves a maze. Otherwise, it will print that the maze is not possible. 
                
            </li>
            <li>I used Java to code this program; there were three methods!</li>
            <li>I liked this project because it made me evolve my code to be more readable and useful by separating the code into their own methods, 
                rather than piling everything into the main method. 
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Sorting Algorithms + Comparisons (Java)</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/WilsonC67/SortAlgorithmComparisons">GitHub</a>
          <ul>
            <li>This program was another project for CSC111. It has three sorting algorithms: Selection, Bubble, and Merge.</li>
            <li>Alongside with these methods, they have their corresponding method to calculate the amount of comparisons it would take to 
                sort arrays of unsorted (and randomly generated) integers. 
                <br>
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>I liked this project because it made me think which step of the sorting process actually compares them.</li>
            <li>Once I had understood where that step was, I was able to slightly tweak the original method to return the amount of comparisons.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Infix to Postfix (Java)</h2>
          <a href="https://github.com/WilsonC67/InfixToPostfix">GitHub</a>
          <ul>
            <li>This program was an in-class activity for CSC111. It takes an infix expression, translates it to postfix, and then returns 
                the answer.
            </li>
            <li>I liked this project a lot because it was an oppurtunity to utilize a new topic we had recently learned: stacks!</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>As I was reading about how to code this program, the way it functioned made so much sense to me.</li>
          </ul>
